		<h1>Reservoir Dogs</h1>
		<p>Reservoir Dogs is a 1992 American heist thriller film written and directed by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/?ref_=tt_ov_dr">Quentin Tarantino</a> in his feature-length debut. It stars <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000172/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm">Harvey Keitel</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000619/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm">Tim Roth</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001606/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t4">Chris Penn</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000114/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t5">Steve Buscemi</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0862937/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t6">Lawrence Tierney</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000514/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm">Michael Madsen</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/?ref_=tt_ov_dr">Tarantino</a>, and criminal-turned-author <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0120483/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t9">Edward Bunker</a>, as members of a botched diamond heist. The film depicts the events before and after the heist. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0051257/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t8">Kirk Baltzz</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0112207/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t7">Randy Brooks</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942833/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t20">Steven Wright</a> also play supporting roles. It incorporates many motifs that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, profanity, and nonlinear storytelling.</p>
		<p>The film has become regarded as a classic of independent film and a cult film. It was named "Greatest Independent Film of all Time" by Empire. Reservoir Dogs was generally well received, and the cast was praised by many critics. Although it was not given much promotion upon release, the film became a modest success in the United States after grossing $2.8 million against its $1.2 million budget. The film was more successful in the United Kingdom, grossing nearly £6.5 million, and it achieved higher popularity after the success of Tarantino's next film, Pulp Fiction (1994). A soundtrack was released featuring songs used in the film, which are mostly from the 1970s.</p>
